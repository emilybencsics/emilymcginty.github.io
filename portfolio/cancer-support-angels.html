            </div>
            <p>
              Cancer Support Angels is a not-for-profit organisation supporting
              individuals affected by cancer across Melbourne, Australia. From
              July 2021 to March 2023, I co-led the organisation's social media
              marketing strategy with a focus on community building, brand
              visibility, and fundraising. The campaign aimed to engage, uplift,
              and support individuals and families navigating cancer while
              encouraging donations to fund practical assistance programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through consistent storytelling, community-driven content, and
              accessible messaging, the campaign helped grow the organisation's
              online presence, strengthened engagement with supporters, and
              positioned Facebook as a key channel for both awareness and
              support.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              The Facebook campaign was designed to build connection, inspire
              action, and create a supportive space for people affected by
              cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I co-led the planning and execution of a consistent content
              strategy that included monthly Survivor Spotlights, weekly Self
              Care Saturday posts, and quarterly giveaways. I sourced ideas,
              wrote content and created visuals and captions in line with the
              organisation's tone. Campaigns were aligned with awareness dates
              and key seasonal moments, with donation messaging gently woven
              into relevant posts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Content was scheduled and published through Buffer with ongoing
              monitoring to guide future planning. Each post was designed to be
              helpful, uplifting, and community-focused, making Facebook a key
              part of the organisation's broader fundraising and support
              efforts.

              <h2>Key Results</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              The Facebook campaign helped build a warm, engaged online
              community while encouraging donations and product sales to support
              those living with cancer.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Delivered consistent content across a 20-month period, including
                80+ Self Care Saturday posts, 20+ Survivor Spotlights, and 6+
                Giveaways
              </li>
              <li>
                Fostered regular interaction and peer support through
                community-focused content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Raised awareness of the organization's support services and
                mission across new audiences.
              </li>
              <li>
                Supported fundraising efforts through increased visibility of
                donation links, blog traffic, and product sales.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While specific metrics were not recorded, qualitative feedback and
              steady page growth reflected a campaign that prioritized impact,
              empathy, and connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campaign helped transform Facebook from a static page into an
              active space for community, care, and conversation, ultimately
              supporting Cancer Support Angels' mission to ensure no one faces
              cancer alone.

              <p>
                This post was chosen to highlight Cancer Support Angels as the
                charity of choice because it builds credibility, increases
                trust, and reinforces the organisation's legitimacy to potential
                donors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Featuring this recognition on Facebook maximizes reach among
                supporters and the wider community, helping to drive donations
                by showing that respected partners have chosen to back the
                cause.

              <h3>Self-Care Saturday</h3>
              <p>
                Posting Self Care Saturday content is a consistent strategy to
                engage the community with value-driven, supportive messaging.
              </p>
              <p>
                These posts encourage ongoing interaction and keep the page
                relevant beyond donation requests, while also positioning Cancer
                Support Angels as a source of practical wellbeing advice for
                patients and carers.
              </p>

              <h3>Research Opportunity</h3>
              <p>
                Sharing relevant research aligns the organisation with
                evidence-based information and shows that Cancer Support Angels
                is informed and connected within the cancer community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Strategically, it builds trust, offers value to followers, and
                encourages shares, expanding reach to new audiences who may then
                discover the organisation's mission and support its work.
