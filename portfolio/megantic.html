            </div>
            <p>
              Megantic is a global organic search agency specialising in SEO for
              eCommerce businesses. I led a brand positioning and PR campaign in
              the 2024 financial year to strengthen Megantic's reputation,
              increase visibility, and drive qualified website traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campaign focused on storytelling and thought leadership,
              bringing Megantic's values, client results, and industry insights
              to life through written content. This included a structured blog
              strategy, strategic press coverage, and internal brand messaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              All content was tailored to highlight the agency's global
              footprint and specialized service offering, with a focus on
              relevance, clarity, and consistency. The campaign was also
              designed to align with the agency's commercial goals and long-term
              brand positioning.

            <div class="section-title">
              <h2>Campaign Strategy</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              The Social in Pink campaign was designed to support time-poor
              small business owners who wanted to improve their Instagram
              presence but didn't know where to start. The strategy blended
              content marketing, visual branding, and platform-specific
              techniques to create an Instagram account that felt helpful,
              friendly, and easy to follow.
            </p>
            <h3 class="portfolio-subheader">Content Pillars</h3>
            <p>
              The campaign was structured around three core content pillars:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Education: Posts that explained key concepts in simple,
                actionable ways (e.g. “How to launch a product on Instagram” or
                “What is a social media strategy?”).
              </li>
              <li>
                Inspiration: Quotes and memes that kept things light, relatable,
                and shareable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engagement: Content designed to spark saves, comments, and
                shares through questions, lists, and bite-sized tips.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each post was carefully considered to either teach, encourage, or
              connect with the audience. Content was planned in monthly batches
              and rotated across formats to keep the feed fresh while
              maintaining consistency.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/assets/img/case-studies/social-in-pink-branding.png"
              alt="Social in Pink brand colors"
              width="200px"
              style="float: right"
            />
            <h3 class="portfolio-subheader">Visual Branding</h3>
            <p>
              Creating a strong and consistent visual identity was central to
              building trust and recognition. The branding was intentionally
              soft, feminine, and friendly — designed to stand out from generic
              or overly corporate marketing accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              These colours and typefaces were applied consistently across Canva
              templates, Reels, and quote posts to build a polished but
              approachable visual brand.
            </p>
            <h3 class="portfolio-subheader">Platform Approach (Instagram)</h3>

            <p>
              Instagram was chosen for its accessibility and strong presence
              among retail business owners. The campaign used a platform-first
              approach, meaning every post was optimised for Instagram's unique
              behaviour and layout:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Carousels: Used for educational content, formatted with hooks on
                slide one and tips in numbered lists.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reels: Short videos created in Canva and posted natively to
                align with trending formats.
              </li>
              <li>
                Captions: Written in plain, conversational language, often
                including questions or prompts to drive engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hashtags & Scheduling: Selected based on Australian business and
                retail visibility; posted at times aligned with audience
                behaviour.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each post included a clear goal — whether it was to drive profile
              visits, encourage a save, or build a sense of community.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- ======= Results Section ======= -->
          <div class="portfolio-description">
            <div class="section-title">
              <h2>Key Results</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              In it's first 10 weeks, Social in Pink demonstrated rapid and
              consistent growth across all key Instagram performance metrics. By
              focusing on strategic content creation, building a community, and
              a cohesive visual identity, the account saw standout engagement
              and reach. Highlights include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Follower Growth:</strong> Increased by over 1,400%, from
                14 to 220 followers
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Engagement Rate:</strong> Averaged over 140%, peaking at
                244%
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Reach:</strong> Jumped from 0 to over 3,700 accounts
                reached in a single week
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Content Interactions:</strong> Surged from 18 to 297,
                with week-on-week growth in likes, saves, and comments
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Impressions:</strong> Climbed to over 4,000 impressions
                during peak weeks
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These results were not driven by ad spend or paid promotions.
              Instead, they came from a clear, thoughtful strategy that
              prioritised what the audience wanted to see, a consistent brand
              look and feel, and regular content adjustments based on what was
              working best.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campaign proved just how powerful a focused and well-executed
              organic strategy can be, especially for small brands looking to
              grow without a large marketing budget.

              </p>
              <p>
                I shared global and Australian retail data, real client results,

                This press release announced that Megantic was awarded Best
                Global Large SEO Agency at the 2024 Global Search Awards.
